# SchoolRFIDSystem
RFID Technology for Schools Attendance and payment Systems ​

RFID can be integrated and used for schools as an attendance and payment system, making both systems fully automated. ​

# Attendance​
- Once a student enters the school bus, the school, or their class, they scan their RFID tag. ​
- Automatically records the student as “present” in the school’s database. ​
- An SMS msg is sent to the parent after scanning the RFID tag upon arrival to the school. ​

# Payment
- Buying school supplies or food from the school using RFID tags instead of cash.  ​
- Parents pay the system, and the money is stored as a number in the tag.  ​
- A budget limit specified for each tag. ​
- In case of theft, parents can deactivate the tags. ​
- An SMS msg is sent to the parent after scanning the RFID tag upon purchase. ​
